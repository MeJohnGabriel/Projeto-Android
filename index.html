        <h2 class="topDois">THE FIRST LOOKS</h2>
        <p class="pDois">
            The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer
            named <a
                href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/"
                target="_blank" class="externo">
                <strong>Dan Morrill</strong>.</a> He says he opened Inkscape (free software for
            vectorizing images)
            and created his own version of the robot. The objective was just to personify the system
            for its team only, there was no request from the
            company to create a mascot.</p>

        <p class="pDois">This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: the Dandroids.</p>
        <h2 class="topDois">THE NEW ERA BEGINS</h2>
        <p class="pDois">Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter
            way. The design should also generate
            quick identification with those who look at it. The
            n Bugdroid appeared, Android's new mascot.</p>

        </picture>
        <p class="pDois">The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's
            features came from those little dolls that illustrate
            bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her
            desk in the Google office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple,
            clean, objective.

        <p class="pDois">Bugdroid, also known as the Android Robot, is the official mascot of the Android operating
            system. Created by designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irina_Blok" target="_blank"
                class="externo">Irina
                Blok</a>, it features a simple, friendly design inspired by
            a robot and
            resembles a green alien-like figure with antennae. The mascot has become an iconic symbol

                Another curious issue regarding Android is that each version has always been
                named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from

                Unfortunately, Android Q did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun
                practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.
